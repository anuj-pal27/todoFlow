## ‚ú® Features
- **User Authentication:** Sign up, log in, and secure JWT-based sessions.
- **Kanban Dashboard:** Drag-and-drop tasks across columns (To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Task CRUD:** Create, edit, delete, and view tasks with priority and assignee.
- **Smart Assign:** Automatically assign tasks to the user with the lightest workload.
- **Real-Time Updates:** All users see task and activity log changes instantly via WebSocket.
- **Activity Log Sidebar:** See a live feed of all actions (create, update, delete, assign).
- **Conflict Handling:** Prevents accidental overwrites when multiple users edit the same task.
- **Responsive UI:** Modern, mobile-friendly design.

## üìù Usage Guide
1. **Sign Up / Log In:**
   - Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.
2. **Dashboard:**
   - View all tasks in Kanban columns.
   - Drag and drop tasks to change status.
   - Click a task to view or edit details.
3. **Create Task:**
   - Use the "+" button to add a new task.
   - Fill in title, description, priority, and (optionally) assignee.
4. **Edit Task:**
   - Click a task card, then "Edit".
   - Make changes and save. If another user has updated the task, you‚Äôll see a conflict dialog to merge or overwrite changes.
5. **Smart Assign:**
   - Use the "Smart Assign" button to auto-assign a task to the user with the fewest active (not Done) tasks.
6. **Activity Log:**
   - The sidebar shows a real-time feed of all actions, with user, action type, and details.

---

## ü§ñ Smart Assign Logic
- When "Smart Assign" is triggered, the backend:
  1. Fetches all users.
  2. Counts each user‚Äôs active (not Done) tasks.
  3. Assigns the task to the user with the fewest active tasks.
  4. Logs the assignment in the activity log and broadcasts the update in real time.

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Conflict Handling Logic
- Each task has a `version` field.
- When editing, the frontend sends the current version.
- If the backend detects the version has changed (another user updated the task), it returns a 409 Conflict with the latest data.
- The frontend shows a dialog to let the user merge their changes or overwrite with the latest version, preventing accidental data loss.

## Environment Variables Setup

### Backend (`todoflow_backend/.env`)
Create a `.env` file in your `todoflow_backend` directory with the following variables:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000 # or any port you want the backend to run on
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 # or your deployed frontend URL
WS_PORT=8080 # or any port for WebSocket server
```

**Descriptions:**
- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string (get from your MongoDB provider or local setup)
- `PORT`: Port for the Express backend server
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for signing JWT tokens (choose a strong, random value)
- `FRONTEND_URL`: URL where your frontend is hosted (used for CORS)
- `WS_PORT`: Port for the WebSocket server

---

### Frontend (`todoflow_frontend/.env`)
Create a `.env` file in your `todoflow_frontend` directory with the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000 # or your deployed backend URL
REACT_APP_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080 # or your deployed WebSocket URL
```

**Descriptions:**
- `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`: URL of your backend API (must match the backend's `PORT` and deployment address)
- `REACT_APP_WS_URL`: WebSocket server URL (must match the backend's `WS_PORT` and deployment address)

---

**Note:**
- Never commit your `.env` files or secrets to version control.
- For production, use secure, unique values for all secrets and connection strings.
- If deploying, update these URLs to match your production domains and ports.
