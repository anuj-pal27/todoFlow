## üìù Usage Guide
1. **Sign Up / Log In:**
   - Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.
2. **Dashboard:**
   - View all tasks in Kanban columns.
   - Drag and drop tasks to change status.
   - Click a task to view or edit details.
3. **Create Task:**
   - Use the "+" button to add a new task.
   - Fill in title, description, priority, and (optionally) assignee.
4. **Edit Task:**
   - Click a task card, then "Edit".
   - Make changes and save. If another user has updated the task, you‚Äôll see a conflict dialog to merge or overwrite changes.
5. **Smart Assign:**
   - Use the "Smart Assign" button to auto-assign a task to the user with the fewest active (not Done) tasks.
6. **Activity Log:**
   - The sidebar shows a real-time feed of all actions, with user, action type, and details.

## ü§ñ Smart Assign Logic
- When "Smart Assign" is triggered, the backend:
  1. Fetches all users.
  2. Counts each user‚Äôs active (not Done) tasks.
  3. Assigns the task to the user with the fewest active tasks.
  4. Logs the assignment in the activity log and broadcasts the update in real time.

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Conflict Handling Logic
- Each task has a `version` field.
- When editing, the frontend sends the current version.
- If the backend detects the version has changed (another user updated the task), it returns a 409 Conflict with the latest data.
- The frontend shows a dialog to let the user merge their changes or overwrite with the latest version, preventing accidental data loss.
